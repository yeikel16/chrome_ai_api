## Install

1. Add the following lines to your project dependencies

    ```yaml
    chrome_prompt_api:
        git: https://github.com/yeikel16/chrome_prompt_api.git
    ```

    > Run `flutter pub get`

2. Make sure than you have install [Chrome Canary][chrome_canary_link] in you machine and complate every steps from [Built-in AI Early Preview Program][chrome_prompt_guide_link] setup guide.

    The session status be one of the following:

    * "readily": the model is available on-device and so creating will happen quickly
    * "after-download": the model is not available on-device, but the device is capable,
    so creating the session will start the download process (which can take a while).
    * "no": the model is not available for this device.

    > Since the Gemeni API currently has no way of knowing the download progress ([issue #4][issue_4]) of the model, you will have to monitor your network activity. The model weighs around 1.37 GB.

3. Run example:
    **Option A:** The easy wahy is copy the URL after run the example project into [Chrome Canary][chrome_canary_link]y version. The normal version of Chrome not work beacause the Gemini API is only aviable in Chrome Dev channel (or [Canary][chrome_canary_link] channel).
    **Option B:**  [Compile the example][app-for-release] and launch a web server (for example, `python -m http.server 8000`, or by using the **dhttpd** package), and open the `/build/web` directory and opem `localhost:8000` in your [Chrome Canary][chrome_canary_link] browser.
